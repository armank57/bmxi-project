- Claim: A player can claim a tile (a) if it is a resource tile, or (b) if it is neighboring a tile that the player already owns. Claiming a tile costs money.
- Build: A player can build on resource tiles that they have claimed. Building costs materials and money.
- Attack: A player can attack other players if they are able 
- Upgrade: A player can choose to upgrade the range of their attacks. Upgrading costs money and stone.
- Sell: Players can sell items at a trading post which is located in the corners of the map. If players choose to sell, all their items will be sold and they will be compensated with money.
